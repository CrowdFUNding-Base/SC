# Feature 3: Borderless Liquidity Rail (Global Rail)

**"Donate USDC, Receive IDRX."**

## Overview

The Borderless Liquidity Rail is a universal adapter for specific global donations. It allows international supporters to donate using **USDC** or **ETH** on Base. The protocol automatically swaps these assets into **IDRX** in a single atomic transaction.

## What it solves

- **Volatility Risk**: Campaigners (NGOs) often fear crypto price swings. This feature guarantees they receive stable IDRX.
- **Global Access**: Unlocks funding from the global crypto-economy for specific local Indonesian causes.

## Technical Flow

`[Global Wallet] -> [Send 10 USDC] -> [Smart Contract Router] -> [Swap USDC to IDRX via Aerodrome/Uniswap] -> [Credit Campaign Vault]`

## Why it matters

It creates a true "Global-Local" bridge. A donor in New York can support a flood relief victim in Jakarta instantly, with the recipient getting spendable local currency value immediately.
