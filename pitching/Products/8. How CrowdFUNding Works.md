# 8. How CrowdFUNding Works

CrowdFUNding operates as a decentralized marketplace matching capital with causes, powered by the Base blockchain.

**Step-by-Step Workflow**

1.  **Campaign Creation**
    - **User Action**: A Creator (Individual/NGO) connects their wallet and fills out campaign details (Title, Description, Target Amount, Deadline).
    - **System Action**: A smart contract creates a new instance of a `Campaign` contract customized for this project.

2.  **Discovery**
    - **User Action**: Donors browse campaigns, filtered by category or trending status (hot on leaderboard).
    - **System Action**: Frontend fetches metadata from Backend (Ponder/API) and on-chain status (Amount Raised) from Base.

3.  **Donation (The "Pay" Step)**
    - **Route A (International/Crypto)**: User sends ETH/USDC. Smart contract swaps it to IDRX -> Sends to Campaign.
    - **Route B (Domestic/Fiat)**: User pays via QRIS (Midtrans). Backend verifies payment -> Backend Wallet sends IDRX to Campaign -> Mints NFT for User.

4.  **Gamification (The "Fun" Step)**
    - **System Action**: Upon successful donation, the `DonationNFT` contract mints a badge to the user's wallet.
    - **User Action**: User claims their "Level 1 Supporter" badge and shares it on Twitter.

5.  **Fund Management & Withdrawal**
    - **Campaigner Action**: Once the goal is met or deadline passes, the Campaigner requests withdrawal.
    - **System Action**: Smart contract checks conditions. If valid, IDRX is released to the Campaigner's wallet (or off-ramped to their bank via IDRX partners).

6.  **Verification**
    - **System Action**: All flows are permanently recorded. Anyone can audit who donated how much and when funds were withdrawn.
