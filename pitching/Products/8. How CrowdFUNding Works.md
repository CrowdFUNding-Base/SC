# 8. How CrowdFUNding Works

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of how the CrowdFUNding platform operates, from user registration to fund withdrawal.

## Platform Overview

CrowdFUNding is a **gamified crowdfunding platform** built on **Base blockchain** that enables transparent, borderless fundraising with NFT achievements.

The platform serves two main user types:
- **Campaign Creators** who raise funds for their projects
- **Donors** who contribute in multiple currencies (BASE, USDC, IDRX)

The following diagram shows the high-level interaction between users and the platform:

```mermaid

        Track["Track Progress"]
        Withdraw["Withdraw Funds"]
    end

    subgraph Platform["CrowdFUNding"]
        Campaigns["Campaign Pool"]
        Swap["Auto-Swap"]
        Badges["Achievement System"]
    end

    subgraph Donors["Donors"]
        Discover["Discover"]
        Donate["Donate"]
        Earn["Earn Badges"]
    end

```

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: User Onboarding

Users can join CrowdFUNding through multiple methods, accommodating both crypto-native and non-crypto users. The platform prioritizes accessibility without sacrificing security.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph OptionA["Option A: Wallet First"]
        A1["Connect MetaMask/Coinbase"]
        A2["Optionally link Google account"]
    end

    subgraph OptionB["Option B: Social First"]
        B1["Sign in with Google"]
        B2["Embedded wallet created automatically"]
        B3["No seed phrase needed!"]
    end

    subgraph OptionC["Option C: Farcaster"]
        C1["Open Farcaster Frame"]
        C2["Connect with Farcaster account"]
    end

    OptionA --> Ready["Ready to Use"]
    OptionB --> Ready
    OptionC --> Ready
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Wallet First**: For crypto-native users who already have wallets
- **Social First**: For newcomers who don't want to manage seed phrases
- **Farcaster**: For social-first users who value community integration

### Step 2: Creating a Campaign

Campaign creators start their fundraising journey by submitting a campaign form. The data is split between on-chain and off-chain storage for optimal gas efficiency.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Creator
    participant Frontend
    participant Wallet
    participant Contract as Campaign.sol
    participant Backend
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Note over Creator,Frontend: Fill campaign form
    Creator->>Frontend: Enter name, target, description
    Frontend->>Frontend: Validate input
    
    Note over Frontend,Contract: On-chain transaction
    Frontend->>Wallet: Request signature
    Wallet->>Contract: createCampaign(name, creatorName, target)
    Contract->>Contract: Store CampaignStruct
    Contract->>Contract: Emit CampaignCreated event
    
    Note over Frontend,DB: Store off-chain data
    Frontend->>Backend: POST description, images
    Backend->>DB: Insert campaign metadata
    
    Note over Contract,Creator: Confirmation
    Contract-->>Frontend: Transaction confirmed
    Frontend->>Creator: Campaign is live!
```

**On-chain data**: name, creatorName, targetAmount, owner, creationTime  
**Off-chain data**: description, images, category, social links

### Step 3: Making a Donation

The donation system supports multiple currencies with automatic conversion to IDRX. This ensures campaign creators always receive a stable, predictable currency while donors can use their preferred token.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Input["Donor Chooses Currency"]
        BASE["BASE (ETH)"]
        USDC["USDC"]
        IDRX["IDRX"]
    end

    subgraph Process["Auto-Swap System"]
        SwapETH["swapETHForToken()"]
        SwapUSDC["swap(USDC, IDRX)"]
        NoSwap["Direct Transfer"]
    end

    subgraph Output["Campaign Receives"]
        Balance["Campaign Balance\n(IDRX only)"]
    end

    BASE --> SwapETH --> Balance
    USDC --> SwapUSDC --> Balance
    IDRX --> NoSwap --> Balance
```

**Why unified currency?**
- Predictable amounts for creators
- Simplified withdrawal process
- Easy off-ramp to Indonesian Rupiah

The following table shows the exchange rates used for conversion:

| Input Currency | Output (per 1 input) | Rate Source |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 BASE (ETH) | 268,400 IDRX | MockSwap contract |
| 1 USDC | 16,775 IDRX | MockSwap contract |
| 1 IDRX | 1 IDRX | No conversion |

### Step 4: Earning Achievements

The gamification system rewards donors with NFT badges for their contributions. This adds a fun, collectible element to the crowdfunding experience.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Milestones["Milestones"]
        M1["First Donation"]
        M2["Donate ≥ 100K IDRX"]
        M3["Donate ≥ 1M IDRX"]
        M4["Top 10 Donor"]
    end

    subgraph Badges["Badges Earned"]
        B1["Pioneer Badge"]
        B2["Silver Contributor"]
        B3["Gold Benefactor"]
        B4["Diamond Patron"]
    end

    M1 --> B1
    M2 --> B2
    M3 --> B3
    M4 --> B4
```

**Campaign milestones** also trigger badges:
- 25% Funded → "Quarter Way There!"
- 50% Funded → "Halfway Hero"
- 75% Funded → "Almost There!"
- 100% Funded → "Goal Reached!"

### Step 5: Tracking Progress

Campaign progress is tracked in real-time through blockchain events. The indexer processes these events and makes them available through APIs.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Live donation feed
- Progress bar toward goal
- Donor leaderboard
- Recent activity timeline

The following data flow shows how progress updates reach users:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Contract as Blockchain
    participant Indexer as Ponder
    participant Backend
    participant Frontend
    participant User

    Contract->>Indexer: Emit DonationReceived
    Indexer->>Indexer: Update campaign balance
    Backend->>Indexer: Poll for updates (30s)
    Indexer-->>Backend: Latest data
    Backend->>Backend: Update cache
    Frontend->>Backend: GET campaign/:id
    Backend-->>Frontend: Campaign with latest balance
    Frontend->>User: Show updated progress
```

### Step 6: Withdrawing Funds

Campaign creators can withdraw accumulated IDRX funds at any time. The smart contract validates ownership and balance before executing the transfer.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Owner
    participant Contract as Campaign.sol
    participant IDRX as IDRX Token
    participant Wallet as Owner's Wallet

    Owner->>Contract: withdraw(campaignId, amount)
    
    Note over Contract: Security Checks
    Contract->>Contract: ✓ ReentrancyGuard
    Contract->>Contract: ✓ Verify msg.sender == owner
    Contract->>Contract: ✓ Verify balance >= amount
    
    Note over Contract,Wallet: Execute Transfer
    Contract->>Contract: campaigns[id].balance -= amount
    Contract->>IDRX: safeTransfer(owner, amount)
    IDRX->>Wallet: IDRX credited
    
    Contract->>Contract: Emit FundWithdrawn
    Contract-->>Owner: Transaction confirmed
```

**What can creators do with IDRX?**
- Hold in wallet as savings
- Swap to other tokens (USDC, ETH)
- Off-ramp to Indonesian Rupiah via IDRX partners
- Use for other DeFi activities

## Security Overview

Security is implemented at every layer of the platform:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph SC["Smart Contract"]
        Re["ReentrancyGuard"]
        Safe["SafeERC20"]
        Owner["Owner Validation"]
    end

    subgraph BE["Backend"]
        JWT["JWT Auth"]
        Val["Input Validation"]
        Rate["Rate Limiting"]
    end

    subgraph FE["Frontend"]
        Wallet["Wallet Signatures"]
        HTTPS["HTTPS Only"]
    end

    SC --> BE --> FE
```

The following table summarizes security measures:

| Layer | Threat | Mitigation |
