# 8. How CrowdFUNding Works

CrowdFUNding operates as a decentralized marketplace matching capital with causes, powered by the Base blockchain.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Campaign Creation (The Setup)

- **User Action**: A Creator (Individual/NGO) connects their wallet and fills out campaign details.
- **System Action**: A smart contract creates a new instance of a `CampaignVault` on Base.

### 2. Discovery (The Browse)

- **User Action**: Donors browse campaigns, filtered by category or trending status (hot on leaderboard).
- **System Action**: Frontend fetches metadata from Ponder API and verified on-chain status from Base.

### 3. Donation (The "Pay" Step)

- **Route A: Instant Fiat Gateway (Local)**
  - User scans QRIS via GoPay/OVO/BCA.
  - Backend verifies payment $\rightarrow$ Auto-mints IDRX to Campaign Vault.
- **Route B: Borderless Liquidity Rail (Global)**
  - User sends ETH/USDC via Base wallet.
  - Smart Contract auto-swaps to **IDRX** $\rightarrow$ Sends to Campaign Vault.

### 4. Gamification (The "Fun" Step)

- **System Action**: Upon successful donation, the `ImpactPet` contract mints or updates the user's NFT.
- **User Action**: User sees their Pet evolve (e.g., Egg $\rightarrow$ Hatchling) and shares the "Level Up" moment on Instagram/TikTok.

### 5. Automated Settlement (The Offramp)

- **Campaigner Action**: Once the goal is met, Campaigner requests withdrawal.
- **System Action**: Smart contract checks conditions. IDRX is released to the Campaigner or off-ramped directly to their local bank account in Rupiah.

### 6. Verification (The Trust)

- **System Action**: All flows are permanently recorded on-chain. Anyone can verify the transaction hash to see exactly where the money went.
