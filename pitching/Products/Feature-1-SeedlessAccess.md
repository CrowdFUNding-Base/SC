# Feature 1: Seedless Access (The Onramp)

**"Log in like it's Gmail."**

## Overview

Seedless Access utilizes **Base OnchainKit** and Account Abstraction to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3. It allows users to login with familiar credentials (Gmail) while the system creates a secure smart wallet in the background.

## What it solves

- **Onboarding Friction**: Eliminates the "install wallet $\rightarrow$ save seed phrase" hurdle.
- **Mass Adoption**: Unlocks the 67M+ Indonesian user base who are familiar with QRIS/E-Wallets but not Crypto.

## Technical Flow

`[Start Login] -> [Google OAuth via Privy] -> [Identity Verified] -> [Create/Load Base Smart Wallet] -> [Dashboard Access]`

## Why it matters

By removing the "Web3 Wall," CrowdFUNding ensures that anyone, from a university student to a rural donor, can participate in the onchain economy without technical hurdles.
