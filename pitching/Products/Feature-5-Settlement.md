# Feature 5: Automated Bank Settlement (The Offramp)

**"Crypto to Rupiah, Instantly."**

## Overview

Automated Settlement is the final leg of the journey. Once a campaign reaches its goal or verified milestone, the smart contract permits the off-ramping of IDRX directly to the campaign creator's local bank account.

## What it solves

- **The "Last Mile" Problem**: Crypto is useless if it can't buy rice or medicine. This feature bridges the onchain value back to the real world.
- **Trust**: Funds are only released when specific smart contract conditions are met, preventing early withdrawal or misuse.

## Technical Flow

`[Goal Met] -> [Campaigner Request Withdrawal] -> [Smart Contract Verification] -> [IDRX to Fiat Bridge] -> [Transfer to Local Bank Account]`

## Why it matters

It completes the loop. It ensures that while the technology is "Onchain," the impact is strictly "Real World," settling in the currency that local vendors accept.
