# Feature 4: Dynamic Proof of Impact (Gamification)

**"Your Impact, Visualized."**

## Overview

This feature replaces the static "Thank You" email with a living, breathing **Digital Pet (NFT)**. This pet evolves based on the user's donation behavior—growing from an egg to a mature companion as the donor maintains their "Impact Streak."

## What it solves

- **Donor Fatigue**: Fixes the 19% retention rate by introducing a compelling "Game Loop" (Tamagotchi-style) that encourages recurring giving.
- **Economic Stagnation**: Taps into the $445M virtual goods market, redirecting spend from purely cosmetic game items to social impact assets.

## Technical Flow

`[Donation Confirmed] -> [Check NFT Status] -> (No Pet? Mint Egg) / (Has Pet? Add XP & Evolve) -> [Metadata Updated On-Chain]`

## Why it matters

It shifts the psychology of giving from "loss" (giving money away) to "gain" (building a digital legacy). It also creates viral loops as users share their evolved pets on social media.
