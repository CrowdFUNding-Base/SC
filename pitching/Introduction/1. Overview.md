# 1. Overview

## Donate. Evolve. Impact.

**CrowdFUNding** is a revolutionary fundraising layer built on Base that transforms the transactional act of giving into a gamified lifestyle. CrowdFUNding addresses the "Donor Death Spiral" where 81% of contributors exit after a single transaction and 12.66% of donation value is lost to banking fees.

By bridging the gap between high-velocity Web3 mechanics and Indonesia's status as the #1 most generous nation, the platform eliminates "donor fatigue" and replaces it with a "positive-sum game." Every contribution creates an immutable, evolving digital legacy, turning the "Generational Exit" of Gen Z donors into a lifetime of verifiable impact.

## Why Built on Base?

Base is the only ecosystem capable of supporting a high-frequency, low-margin consumer application that requires the speed and affordability of Web2 with the trustlessness of Web3:

- **Micro-Donation Viability**: Base's near-zero transaction fees allow the protocol to process donations as small as Rp 10,000 (~$0.65) without the fees eating the impact—solving the "12.66% Financial Tax" problem.
- **Consumer Crypto Standard**: CrowdFUNding aligns perfectly with Base's mission to shift the narrative from speculative "PvP Casinos" to meaningful "PvE Communities," bringing the next billion users onchain through real-world utility.
- **Seamless UX with Base OnchainKit**: Leveraging Account Abstraction, the app offers "Seedless Onboarding" via Google/Privy, making the transition from a standard Web2 app to an onchain protocol completely invisible to the user.

## Why CrowdFUNding Matters for Base & IDRX

CrowdFUNding builds the primary infrastructure rail that connects Global Capital to Local Impact:

- **For Base (The Onchain Everyday)**: The platform turns sporadic donors into Daily Active Users (DAU) through gamified "Impact Streaks" and evolving NFT pets. It targets a **65% retention rate** (vs the industry's 19%), proving that Base is the home for sticky, high-retention consumer apps.
- **For IDRX (Real-World Utility)**: By integrating IDRX as the exclusive settlement layer for QRIS and local off-ramps, this project locks significant Rupiah liquidity into smart contracts and provides a mass-market use case for the stablecoin beyond trading—establishing it as the national standard for verifiable philanthropy.
