# 1. Overview

**Overview**
CrowdFUNding is a revolutionary fundraising platform built on Base that reimagines philanthropy by merging robust Web3 financial mechanics with the engaging elements of gamification ("FUN"). Unlike static donation pages, CrowdFUNding transforms the act of giving into an interactive experience, creating a dynamic ecosystem where donors are active participants rather than just sources of funds. By leveraging the speed and low cost of the Base Layer-2 blockchain, we create a borderless, transparent, and trusted environment for creators and contributors alike.

**Why Built on Base**
Base is the ideal foundation for CrowdFUNding due to its "builder-first" ethos and technical superiority:

- **Affordability**: With transaction fees as low as ~$0.01, Base ensures that micro-donations are viable—meaning more money goes to the cause, not gas fees.
- **Performance**: The high throughput of Base enables real-time gamification features (like instant NFT minting upon donation) without network congestion.
- **Ecosystem**: Base's rapidly growing consumer ecosystem provides the perfect launchpad for an app designed for mass adoption.

**Why CrowdFUNding Matters for Base**
CrowdFUNding directly addresses the challenge of onboarding real-world utility to the chain:

- **Driving IDRX TVL**: A core feature of our platform is the automatic conversion of international payments (ETH/USDC) into IDRX (Indonesian Rupiah Stablecoin). This mechanism creates continuous demand and liquidity for IDRX on the Base network.
- **Mainstream Onboarding**: By combining familiar fiat gateways (Midtrans) with seamless Web3 backend processes, we bring non-crypto users onto Base without the friction of complex wallet management.
