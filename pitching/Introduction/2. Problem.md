# 2. Problem

Based on current landscape data and user research, the crowdfunding sector faces several critical issues:

**1. Donation Fatigue & Low Engagement**
Traditional Web2 platforms offer a transactional and sterile experience. Users donate and leave, with little to no ongoing connection to the project. This "fire-and-forget" model leads to low retention rates and donor fatigue.

**2. High Cross-Border Friction**
For international donors wanting to support local causes (e.g., in Indonesia), the barriers are high. Swift transfers are slow and expensive, and credit card processing fees can eat up to 5-10% of the donation.

**3. Lack of Transparency**
A major pain point in philanthropy is the "black box" of fund utilization. Donors rarely see when and how their money is spent after the initial transfer, leading to a trust deficit.

**4. Complexity for Non-Natives**
While Web3 solves transparency, it often introduces complexity. Managing private keys, gas fees, and swap rates creates a high barrier to entry for the average benevolent internet user.
