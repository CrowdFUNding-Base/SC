# 4. Features

CrowdFUNding combines the familiarity of Web2 with the power of Web3 through five core features designed to maximize velocity and retention.

## 1. Seedless Access (The Onramp)

**"Log in like it's Gmail."**
Users can log in instantly using their Google account via **Base OnchainKit** and Privy ID. This bypasses the biggest barrier to entry in Web3—the seed phrase—making the platform accessible to everyone, from university students to rural donors.

- **Process**: Login $\rightarrow$ Google OAuth $\rightarrow$ Identity Verified $\rightarrow$ Dashboard Access.

## 2. Instant Fiat Gateway (Local Rail)

**"Scan QRIS, Settle On-Chain."**
Local donors can scan a standard QRIS code using any banking app (GoPay, OVO, BCA). The funds strictly settle as **IDRX** on the Base network, ensuring immediate liquidity without the 12.66% leakage of traditional gateways.

- **Process**: Amount $\rightarrow$ QRIS Scan $\rightarrow$ IDR Payment $\rightarrow$ Auto-Mint to Hub $\rightarrow$ Campaign Vault.

## 3. Borderless Liquidity Rail (Global Rail)

**"Donate USDC, Receive IDRX."**
Global supporters can donate USDC on Base. The protocol automatically swaps these assets into IDRX. This unlocks global philanthropy for local causes while protecting local recipients from exchange rate volatility.

- **Process**: Global Wallet $\rightarrow$ USDC on Base $\rightarrow$ Auto-Swap $\rightarrow$ Stable IDRX $\rightarrow$ Campaign Vault.

## 4. Dynamic Proof of Impact (Gamification)

**"Your Impact, Visualized."**
Contributors receive a **Digital Pet** on Base that serves as a verifiable on-chain record. This isn't just a static JPEG; it evolves based on donation history and "Impact Streaks."

- **Loop**: Donation Confirmed $\rightarrow$ Existing NFT? (No: Mint / Yes: Evolve) $\rightarrow$ Share to Socials.
- **Network Effect**: Viral sharing on TikTok/Instagram drives organic growth.

## 5. Automated Bank Settlement (The Offramp)

**"Crypto to Rupiah, Instantly."**
Campaign creators (NGOs) can trigger IDRX funds to be sent directly from the Campaign Vault to their local bank accounts in Rupiah. This ensures the money is ready for real-world use immediately, solving the "last mile" problem.

- **Process**: Goal Met $\rightarrow$ Release Fund $\rightarrow$ IDRX/Bank Bridge $\rightarrow$ Local Bank $\rightarrow$ Rupiah Received.
