# 4. Features

**1. Borderless Transaction Engine**

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Accept ETH, USDC, and other ERC-20 tokens from global users.
- **Auto-Conversion**: Smart contracts automatically desire-swap incoming crypto assets into IDRX via DEX integration, mitigating volatility risk for campaigners.
- **Fiat On-Ramp**: Seamless integration with Midtrans allows local users to donate via Bank Transfer, GoPay, or QRIS, which is then tokenized into IDRX on the backend.

**2. Gamified Donation Experience**

- **NFT Tiers**: Donors receive evolving NFTs based on their contribution amount (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold Support Badges).
- **Leaderboards**: Real-time "Top Donor" and "Most Active Community" boards to foster healthy competition.
- **Quests**: Special campaigns where completing social tasks or donation streaks earns bonus XP/rewards.

**3. Easy Authentication**

- **Social Login**: Users can sign up using Google or Email, creating a non-custodial wallet under the hood (Account Abstraction).
- **Wallet Connect**: Native support for MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and other Web3 wallets for crypto-native users.

**4. Transparent Stewardship**

- **On-Chain History**: A public ledger of all incoming donations and outgoing withdrawals.
