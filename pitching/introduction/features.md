# 4. Features

CrowdFUNding combines the familiarity of Web2 with the power of Web3 through five core features designed to maximize velocity and retention.

## 1. Seedless Access (The Onramp)

> **As a user**, I can log in instantly using my Google account, bypassing the need to manage a blockchain address or seed phrase.

Users can log in instantly using their Google account via **Base OnchainKit** and Privy ID. This bypasses the biggest barrier to entry in Web3—the seed phrase—making the platform accessible to everyone, from university students to rural donors.

## 2. Instant Fiat Gateway (Local Rail)

> **As a local donor**, I can scan a QRIS code with my favorite banking app to send funds that settle instantly as IDRX on the Base network.

Local donors can scan a standard QRIS code using any banking app (GoPay, OVO, BCA). The funds settle as **IDRX** on the Base network, ensuring immediate liquidity without the 12.66% leakage of traditional gateways.

## 3. Borderless Liquidity Rail (Global Rail)

> **As a global supporter**, I can donate USDC or other stablecoins on Base and have it automatically converted to IDRX to protect the recipient from volatility.

Global supporters can donate USDC on Base. The protocol automatically swaps these assets into IDRX, unlocking global philanthropy for local causes while protecting recipients from exchange rate volatility.

## 4. Dynamic Proof of Impact (Gamification)

> **As a contributor**, I receive a digital pet on Base that evolves to provide a verifiable on-chain record of my impact, with an optional button to share my progress to social media.

Contributors receive a **Digital Pet** on Base that serves as a verifiable on-chain record. It evolves based on donation history and "Impact Streaks," driving viral sharing on social media.

## 5. Automated Bank Settlement (The Offramp)

> **As a campaign creator**, I can have IDRX funds sent directly from the Campaign Vault to my local bank account in Rupiah, ensuring the money is ready for real-world use.

Campaign creators can trigger IDRX funds to be sent directly from the Campaign Vault to their local bank accounts in Rupiah, solving the "last mile" problem for real-world use.
