# 11. Business Model & Revenue

CrowdFUNding operates on a sustainable "Low Tax, High Volume" model enabled by Base L2 efficiencies, supplemented by high-margin virtual goods sales.

## 1. Platform Fee (The Volume Game)

**2.5% Flat Fee per Donation**

- **Competitive Edge**: This is **50% lower** than the industry standard (Kitabisa/BenihBaik charge ~5%).
- **Why it works**: Base L2 fees (~$0.01) are so low that we can afford to undercut incumbents while still maintaining healthy margins.
- **Micro-Donation Volume**: Lower fees unlock the viability of $1 donations, massively increasing the total volume of transactions (# of txs).

## 2. Digital Marketplace (The Margin Game)

**NFT Cosmetics & Power-Ups**

- **Cosmetic Assets**: Selling skins, accessories, and backgrounds for "Impact Pets."
- **Premium Minting**: Fees for minting specialized "Soulbound" badges for high-net-worth achievements.
- **Psychology**: Monetizes user engagement and ego (status) rather than taxing the act of altruism itself. Margins on virtual goods are typically **95%+**.

## 3. B2B Infrastructure (The Trust Scale)

**CSR API Licensing**

- **Target**: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) departments.
- **Product**: An API that provides real-time, audit-ready impact dashboards.
- **Value**: Replaces expensive manual audits ($10k+) with a "System That Never Lies," turning social spending into verifiable, on-chain financial facts for annual reports.
