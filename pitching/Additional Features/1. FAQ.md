# 1. FAQ

**Q: Is CrowdFUNding fully decentralized?**
A: The core financial logic (donations, swaps, withdrawals) is fully decentralized on Base. However, we currently use a backend for optional gamification metadata (leaderboards) and fiat payment processing integration.

**Q: How does the auto-swap work?**
A: When you donate ETH or USDC, our smart contract interacts with a DEX Router (like Uniswap/Aerodrome) in the same transaction to swap your tokens into IDRX, which is then sent to the campaign's vault.

**Q: Are there fees?**
A: The platform takes a small 1% fee on withdrawals to sustain operations and fund the "Community Treasury". Base network gas fees are paid by the donor (usually <$0.05).

**Q: What is IDRX?**
A: IDRX is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Indonesian Rupiah, audited and authorized.

**Q: Can I use any wallet?**
A: Yes! You can use MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rabbit, or even a Social Login (powered by Account Abstraction) if you don't have a wallet yet.
