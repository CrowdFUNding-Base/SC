# 6. Base Ecosystem Utilization

Our technical architecture is deeply integrated with the Base stack.

**1. Base Layer-2 Infrastructure**

- **Core Logic**: All campaign registries, donation tracking, and fund vaults are deployed as smart contracts on Base.
- **Why Base**: We utilize the OP Stack's optimistic rollup technology to ensure that a $1 donation doesn't cost $5 in gas. This is critical for the "micro-donation" model.

**2. Smart Wallet & OnchainKit**

- **Smooth Onboarding**: We leverage OnchainKit to provide a familiar interface for wallet connection and profile management.
- **Transaction Sponsoring (Paymaster)**: (Future implementation) Utilizing Base's Paymaster capabilities to subsidize gas for first-time users, making the app truly "gasless" for the donor.

**3. IDRX Integration**

- **Natively Supported**: The platform is hardcoded to recognize IDRX as the base currency.
- **Swapping Logic**: We interact with Base-native DEXs (like Uniswap on Base or Aerodrome) to facilitate the atomic swaps of `TokenIn` -> `IDRX`.
