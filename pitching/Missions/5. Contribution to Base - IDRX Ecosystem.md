# 5. Contribution to Base / IDRX Ecosystem

CrowdFUNding is designed not just as an application, but as a catalyst for ecosystem growth.

**Contribution to IDRX (Indonesian Rupiah Token)**

- **Increasing TVL & Velocity**: By designating IDRX as the primary settlement currency for all campaigns, we ensure a constant flow of value into the IDRX ecosystem. Every donation, whether originally in ETH or Fiat, ends up as IDRX.
- **Real-World Utility**: We demonstrate a clear, non-speculative use case for stablecoins—transparent charity and project funding. This helps legimitize IDRX beyond just a trading pair asset.
- **Price Strengthening**: The auto-buy mechanism (swapping ETH/USDC to IDRX) creates consistent buy pressure, supporting the stablecoin's peg and adoption.

**Contribution to Base**

- **Transaction Volume**: The gamified nature of the platform (minting NFTs, claiming rewards, voting) drives high transaction volume on the Base network.
- **Cross-Border Bridge**: We act as a functional bridge connecting international capital (ETH/USDC holders) to local Indonesian grassroots projects, positioning Base as the premier L2 for emerging market real-world assets (RWA).
- **Showcase of OnchainKit**: By implementing best-in-class UI/UX patterns using OnchainKit, we serve as a reference implementation for other developers in the region.
