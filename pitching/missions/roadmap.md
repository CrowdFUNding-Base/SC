## Phase 2: Social Gaming Layer (Post-Launch)

After achieving mainnet stability and proving the core gamification loop, we unlock the full social competition stack to maximize engagement and retention.

### 1. Inclusive Quests (Proof of Support)
Giving a role to users with "high enthusiasm but low liquidity"—especially students. Reward **Impact Points** for non-monetary contributions like sharing campaigns to WhatsApp groups or leaving supportive comments. Treat Social Capital as equal to Financial Capital.

### 2. Squad Wars & Party Raids
Transforming donations from solo activity into social competition.
- **Squad Leaderboards**: Institutional rivalry (Alumni UGM vs UI, company teams).
- **Party Mode**: Co-op donation slots ("Need 5 people at 50k each"). Fill the party = everyone gets bonus XP. Fail = bonus lost.

### 3. Random Chaos Events
Breaking monotony with unscheduled, high-reward surprises.
- **Happy Hour**: "Flash notification: 3x XP for 30 minutes!"
- **Mystery Drops**: "Donate now for a 50% chance at a Golden Skin."
- **Effect**: FOMO-driven daily engagement—users check the app expecting the unexpected.
