# 12. Go-To-Market Strategy

Our strategy focuses on winning the most digitally native, high-frequency donors first (Gen Z / University Students) before expanding to the mass market.

## Phase 1: Launch (The Spark)

**Target: University Hubs (Yogyakarta)**
Yogyakarta is the "Student City" of Indonesia, home to high concentrations of Gen Z.

- **Entry Point**: Deploy QRIS stands at campus events and student organizations.
- **The Hook**: "Limited Edition" Genesis NFT Pets available only for early university donors.
- **Tech**: **Seedless Access** (Google Login) makes onboarding instant for students who may not have wallets yet.

## Phase 2: Growth (The Engine)

**Focus: Retention & Virality**

- **Impact Streaks**: Gamifying daily habits. Donating Rp 10k/day gives more XP than Rp 100k once. This builds DAU (Daily Active Users).
- **Virality**: "One-Tap Share" to Instagram Stories/TikTok whenever a Pet evolves. "Look at my Dragon level up!" drives organic FOMO.
- **Donation Squads**: Enabling student clubs (BEM/Hima) to compete on leaderboards for "Most Impactful Organization."

## Phase 3: Scale (The Bridge)

**Focus: National & B2B Expansion**

- **B2B Integration**: Rolling out the CSR API for corporate partners.
- **Global Rail**: Activating marketing for the USDC-to-IDRX bridge to attract global crypto-philanthropists.
- **Compliance**: Securing full status within the **OJK Regulatory Sandbox** to allow for national mass-media advertising.
