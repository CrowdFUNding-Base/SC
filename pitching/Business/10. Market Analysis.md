# 10. Market Analysis

We are targeting the intersection of the world's most generous nation and the high-growth virtual goods economy.

## Market Sizing

### TAM (Total Addressable Market) - Global Crowdfunding

**$17.7 Billion** (2024)

- Projected to reach **$20.46 Billion** by 2025.
- _Source: ResearchAndMarkets, 2025._

### SAM (Serviceable Available Market) - Indonesia Philanthropy

**$2.62 Billion**

- This is the National Target for Zakat and Alms (ZIS) collection in 2024.
- **Why it matters**: Indonesia has been ranked the **#1 most generous country in the world** for 7 consecutive years by the CAF World Giving Index. The culture of giving is deeply ingrained, but the rails are inefficient.

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) - Indonesian Virtual Goods

**$445 Million**

- Annual revenue from In-App Purchases (Virtual Goods) in Indonesia video games.
- **The Gap**: Currently, this money is spent on "skins" and "items" with zero real-world value.
- **The Strategy**: CrowdFUNding aims to capture this **"consumption capital"** and redirect it into **"impact capital"** by offering the same dopamine hit (Evolving Pets) but with social good as the underlying asset.
