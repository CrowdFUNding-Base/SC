## Overview

**CrowdFUNding** is a gamified crowdfunding platform built on the Base blockchain. We've reimagined the traditional crowdfunding experience by adding game-like elements to make donating more engaging and rewarding!

### Key Features

- **Campaign Creation**: Create fundraising campaigns with target amounts and track progress
- **Multi-Token Donations**: Support for native currency and ERC20 tokens (IDRX & USDC)
- **Achievement Badges**: Mint NFT badges as achievements for donors and campaign milestones
- **Security First**: Built with OpenZeppelin's battle-tested contracts including ReentrancyGuard

---

## Why Blockchain?

Traditional crowdfunding platforms face significant challenges: **lack of transparency**, **high fees**, and **trust issues**. Blockchain technology solves these problems:

| Problem                        | Blockchain Solution                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opaque fund usage**          | All transactions are publicly verifiable on-chain   |
| **High platform fees** (5-15%) | Direct peer-to-peer donations with minimal gas fees |
| **Geographical restrictions**  | Borderless donations from anywhere in the world     |
| **Fund misappropriation**      | Immutable records ensure accountability             |
| **Slow withdrawals**           | Instant fund access for campaign creators           |

With blockchain, every donation is **transparent**, **traceable**, and **trustless** — donors can verify exactly where their money goes.

---

## Why Base?

We chose **Base** as our primary blockchain for several compelling reasons:

### Performance & Cost

- **Low gas fees** — Up to 10x cheaper than Ethereum mainnet
- **Fast transactions** — Near-instant finality for smooth user experience
- **Scalable** — Built on Optimism's battle-tested OP Stack

### Security & Trust

- **Backed by Coinbase** — Leverages Coinbase's security expertise and reputation
- **Ethereum security** — Inherits Ethereum's robust security as an L2
- **Decentralized** — Committed to progressive decentralization

### Ecosystem & Adoption

- **Growing ecosystem** — Rapidly expanding developer and user community
- **Easy onboarding** — Seamless integration with Coinbase wallet
- **EVM compatible** — Easy migration of existing Solidity code

Base provides the perfect balance of **security**, **speed**, and **cost-efficiency** for a crowdfunding platform.

---

## Why IDRX?

**IDRX** is Indonesia's first and largest rupiah-pegged stablecoin, making it the ideal currency for our platform:

### Local Currency Stability

- **1:1 pegged to IDR** — Donors contribute in familiar currency values
- **No forex volatility** — Campaign targets remain stable in local terms
- **Accessible amounts** — Small donations feel meaningful (not 0.0001 ETH)

### Indonesian Market Focus

- **270M+ population** — Massive potential donor base
- **Growing crypto adoption** — Indonesia ranks 3rd globally in crypto adoption
- **Financial inclusion** — Reaches underbanked populations via mobile wallets

### Technical Benefits

- **ERC20 compatible** — Seamless integration with Base ecosystem
- **2 decimal places** — Mirrors actual IDR for intuitive amounts
- **Regulated** — Compliant with Indonesian financial regulations

By supporting **IDRX alongside USDC**, we enable both **local Indonesian donors** and **international supporters** to contribute effortlessly.

## Auto-Swap: Global Donations Made Easy

One of the most powerful features of CrowdFUNding is the **automatic token swap** functionality. This allows donors from anywhere in the world to contribute using their preferred currency, while campaigns receive funds in a unified format.

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Donor sends   │────▶│   MockSwap       │────▶│   Campaign      │
│   BASE/USDC/    │     │   auto-converts  │     │   receives IDRX │
│   other tokens  │     │   to IDRX        │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

#### Native Token (BASE) Donations:

1. **Donor donates** using BASE native token
2. **Smart contract calls** `swapETHForToken()` on MockSwap
3. **BASE is auto-swapped** to IDRX at the current rate
4. **Campaign receives** the equivalent amount in IDRX

#### ERC20 Token Donations:

1. **Donor donates** with any supported ERC20 token (e.g., USDC)
2. **Smart contract automatically swaps** the token to IDRX via MockSwap
3. **Campaign receives** the equivalent amount in IDRX
4. **Campaign owner withdraws** funds in IDRX

### Benefits

| Feature                    | Benefit                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Native token support**   | Donate with BASE, auto-converted to IDRX     |
| **Multi-currency support** | Accept donations in USDC, IDRX, and more     |
| **Automatic conversion**   | No manual token swaps needed                 |
| **Unified accounting**     | All campaign balances stored in IDRX         |
| **Global accessibility**   | International donors can use familiar tokens |
| **Transparent rates**      | Exchange rates are on-chain and verifiable   |

### Global Reach

This feature is designed to **maximize global participation**:

- **BASE native token** can be used directly, auto-converted to IDRX
- **International donors** can contribute in USDC (widely used globally)
- **Indonesian donors** can contribute directly in IDRX
- **Campaign creators** receive all funds in IDRX for easy local withdrawal
- **No forex hassles** — the smart contract handles everything automatically

### Exchange Rates (Testnet)

| Token | Rate per BASE | Decimals |
| ----- | ------------- | -------- |
| USDC  | 0.16 USDC     | 6        |
| IDRX  | 2,684 IDRX    | 2        |

> **Example**:
>
> - A donation of **1 BASE** would be automatically converted to approximately **2,684 IDRX**
> - A donation of **100 USDC** would be automatically converted to approximately **1,677,500 IDRX** (16,775 IDRX per 1 USDC)

## Smart Contract Architecture

This project consists of **5 main smart contracts**:

### 1. **Campaign.sol** - Core Crowdfunding Contract

The heart of the platform. Manages all crowdfunding campaigns with integrated auto-swap functionality.

| Function                              | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `createCampaign()`                    | Create a new fundraising campaign with name, creator, and target amount |
| `donate(uint256)`                     | Donate BASE native token to a campaign (auto-swaps to IDRX)             |
| `donate(uint256, uint256, address)`   | Donate ERC20 tokens (auto-swaps to IDRX if needed)                      |
| `withdraw(uint256, uint256)`          | Withdraw IDRX from a campaign                                           |
| `withdraw(uint256, uint256, address)` | Withdraw specific ERC20 tokens from a campaign                          |
| `getCampaignInfo()`                   | Retrieve campaign details (name, balance, target, etc.)                 |

**Features:**

- **Auto-swap integration** — Donations in BASE native token or non-IDRX tokens are automatically converted to IDRX
- Supports both BASE native token and ERC20 token donations
- ReentrancyGuard protection for secure withdrawals
- Event emissions for donation tracking
- Unified storage in IDRX for consistent accounting
- All withdrawals paid out in IDRX

### 2. **Badge.sol** - Achievement NFT Contract

ERC721-based NFT contract for minting achievement badges.

| Function         | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `mintBadge()`    | Mint a new achievement badge (owner only) |
| `getBadgeInfo()` | Get badge details by token ID             |

**Use Cases:**

- First donation badges
- Milestone achievement badges
- Campaign completion badges

### 3. **MockIDRX.sol** - Mock IDRX Token

A mock ERC20 token simulating IDRX (Indonesian Rupiah stablecoin).

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Name     | IDRX  |
| Symbol   | IDRX  |
| Decimals | 2     |

### 4. **MockUSDC.sol** - Mock USDC Token

A mock ERC20 token simulating USDC (USD Coin).

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Name     | USDC  |
| Symbol   | USDC  |
| Decimals | 6     |

### 5. **MockSwap.sol** - Token Swap Contract

Handles automatic token conversions for multi-currency donations.

| Function            | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `addToken()`        | Register a new token with its BASE exchange rate      |
| `swap()`            | Swap tokens from one type to another                  |
| `swapETHForToken()` | Swap BASE native token to ERC20 token                 |
| `getQuote()`        | Get expected output amount for a swap (view function) |
| `getQuoteETH()`     | Get expected output for BASE to token swap (view)     |
| `getTokenInfo()`    | Retrieve token details (address, decimals, rate)      |

**How the Swap Works:**

1. Normalizes input amount to 18 decimals
2. Converts to BASE equivalent using input token's rate
3. Converts BASE to output token using output token's rate
4. Denormalizes to output token's decimals

> **Note**: The Mock tokens and MockSwap are used **only for simulation and testing purposes**. In production, you would integrate with actual token contracts and a real DEX (like Uniswap or Aerodrome).

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# RPC URL for Base Sepolia network
BASE_RPC_URL=your_base_sepolia_rpc_url

# Etherscan API key for contract verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key

# Private key for local Anvil deployment (mock - safe for testing)
LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80

# Private key for deploying to Base Sepolia (use your actual wallet key)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
```

### How to Retrieve Environment Keys

| Variable            | How to Get                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BASE_RPC_URL`      | Sign up at [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) or [Infura](https://infura.io) and create a Base Sepolia app. Copy the HTTP endpoint URL. |
| `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | Register at [Basescan](https://basescan.org) → Go to API Keys → Create a new API key                                                |
| `LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY` | This is the default Anvil Account #0 private key. Safe for local testing only!                                                      |
| `PRIVATE_KEY`       | Export from your wallet (MetaMask: Account Details → Export Private Key). **Never share this!**                                     |

> **Security Warning**: Never commit your `.env` file or share your private keys. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`.

### Option 1: Local Deployment (Anvil)

1. **Start a local Anvil node** (in a separate terminal):

   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

2. **Deploy to local network**:
   ```bash
   make local-deploy
   ```

### Option 2: Base Sepolia Deployment

1. **Ensure your `.env` file is configured** with `BASE_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY`

2. **Deploy to Base Sepolia**:

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Deploy with contract verification**:
   ```bash
   make base-deploy-verify
   ```

---

## Makefile Commands

The Makefile provides convenient shortcuts for common operations:

| Command                   | Environment  | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `make local-dry`          | Local        | Simulates deployment script locally (dry run)  |
| `make local-deploy`       | Local        | Deploys contracts to local Anvil node          |
| `make base-dry`           | Base Sepolia | Simulates deployment on Base Sepolia (dry run) |
| `make base-deploy`        | Base Sepolia | Deploys contracts to Base Sepolia              |
| `make base-deploy-verify` | Base Sepolia | Deploys and verifies contracts on Basescan     |

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Test your deployment locally first
make local-dry

# Start anvil in another terminal, then deploy
make local-deploy

# Dry run on Base Sepolia (simulation only)
make base-dry

# Actually deploy to Base Sepolia
make base-deploy

# Deploy and verify on Basescan
make base-deploy-verify
```

## Minting Mock Tokens

For testing and simulation purposes, we use **Mock IDRX** and **Mock USDC** tokens. These mock tokens allow you to test the donation flow without using real assets.

> **Important**: The Mock IDRX and Mock USDC are **simulation tokens only**. They are not the real IDRX or USDC tokens and have no real-world value. Use them solely for testing the crowdfunding flow.

### Minting Tokens via Cast

After deploying the mock tokens, you can mint tokens using Foundry's `cast` command:

**Mint Mock IDRX:**

```bash
cast send <MOCK_IDRX_ADDRESS> "mint(address,uint256)" <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

**Mint Mock USDC:**

```bash
cast send <MOCK_USDC_ADDRESS> "mint(address,uint256)" <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

### Example (Local Anvil):

```bash
# Mint 1000 IDRX (remember: 2 decimals, so 100000 = 1000 IDRX)
cast send 0x4a49f09fAfA1c493E5FC12dA89Ae8E0193E7e8AE "mint(address,uint256)" 0xYourWallet 100000 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key $LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY

# Mint 1000 USDC (remember: 6 decimals, so 1000000000 = 1000 USDC)
cast send 0xCCEEf0548658839637E5805E39bd52807792C4B9 "mint(address,uint256)" 0xYourWallet 1000000000 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key $LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY
```
